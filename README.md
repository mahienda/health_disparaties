## Overview
 This project explores how socioeconomic and demographic factors influence both perceived health and actual healthcare utilization/expenditure. Using national survey data from NHIS (National Health Interview Survey) and MEPS (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey), the analysis identifies disparities based on education, income, race/ethnicity, gender, and geographic region.

## Research Question
How do socioeconomic and demographic factors shape both self-reported health (NHIS) and actual healthcare expenditures/utilization (MEPS)?



## Motivation

One of my last electives as an economics major was a health economics class. That course really illuminated for me how deeply education, income, and race shape peopleâ€™s access to healthcare and their overall health outcomes. It was eye-opening to see the data behind disparities that are often discussed in broad terms but rarely analyzed in depth.
Now, in my data analytics training, I wanted to build on that foundation. This project gave me the chance to apply what I learned in health economics using real-world data to analyze how socioeconomic and demographic factors influence health. My motivation is to connect that academic insight with actionable analysis, showing where inequities persist even when education and income improve.


## Data Questions(s)

 How can data analytics be used to examine how socioeconomic and demographic factors shape health outcomes in the United States?


Sub-questions:
1.	How does educational attainment impact income distribution and perceived health?
2.	Are there differences in health status across races/ethnicities at different education levels?
3.	How do insurance coverage types vary by education?
4.	Do regional and gender differences exist in healthcare spending?
5. Which groups report the highest rates of poor health despite spending levels?

## Technologies Used
1. Python/Jupyter Notebook
2. Microsoft Power BI
3. Canva

## Known Issues and Challenges
1. Survey limitations: NHIS survey data is self-reported, which can lead to bias or under/over-reporting in health status and healthcare utilization.
2. Causality vs Correlation: The data shows associations between education, income, and health, but it cannot prove direct causation.
